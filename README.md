FormAI is a novel AI-generated dataset comprising 112,000 compilable and independent C programs.   All the programs in the dataset were generated by GPT-3.5-turbo using dynamic zero-shot prompting technique and comprises programs with varying levels of complexity. Some programs handle complicated tasks such as network management, table games, or encryption, while others deal with simpler
tasks like string manipulation. Each program is labelled based on vulnerabilities present in the code using a formal verification method based on the Efficient SMT-based Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC). This strategy conclusively identifies vulnerabilities without reporting false positives. These labeled samples can be utilized to train Large Language Models (LLMs) since they contain the exact program location of the software vulnerability.
# Instructions 
All C programs in this dataset were generated by GPT-3.5-turbo. From the entire dataset 109,757 sample files can be compiled using only the command 'gcc -lm'. However, the remaining 3% of samples are more complex, utilizing external libraries such as OpenSSL, sqlite3, and others. After installing dependencies such as "libsqlite3-dev, libssl-dev, libmysqlclient-dev, libpq-dev, libportaudio2, portaudio19-dev, libpcap-dev, libqrencode-dev, libsdl2-dev, freeglut3-dev, libcurl4-openssl-dev", all files can be compiled.

The dataset includes three files:

**a. FormAI_dataset_C_samples-V1.zip** - This file contains all the 112,000 C files.

**b. FormAI_dataset_classification-V1.zip** - This file contains a CSV file with the following six columns: 1. File name, 2. Vulnerability classification, 3. C source code, 4. Vulnerable function name, 5. Line number, 6. Vulnerability type. One C program can contain multiple vulnerabilities. As such this file has 246550 rows. In the fifth column, each C program preserves the structure of the original code by containing the newline character.

**c. FormAI_dataset_human_readable-V1.csv** - Human readable version, containing only 5 columns without the C code.
To extract the C code from a particular row in the FormAI_dataset.csv and compile it, employ the following command (using row number 3679 as an example):

```bash
gcc -x c <(csvtool drop 3679 FormAI_dataset.csv | csvtool -t ',' head 1 - | csvtool -t ',' col 3 - | sed 's/^"//; s/"$//' | sed 's/""/"/g') -lm -lcrypto -lmysqlclient -lpq -lssl -lportaudio -lpcap -lqrencode -lSDL2 -lglut -lGLU -lGL -lcurl -o output
```
Requirements: In order to compile every C samples one need to install the following libraries: `libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libmysqlclient-dev libpq-dev libportaudio2 portaudio19-dev libpcap-dev libqrencode-dev libsdl2-dev freeglut3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev`

WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN RUNNING THE COMPILED CODES, SOME CAN CONNECT TO THE WEB, SCAN YOUR LOCAL NETWORK, OR DELETE A RANDOM FILE FROM YOUR FILE SYSTEM. ALWAYS CHECK THE SOURCE CODE AND THE COMMENTS IN THE FILE BEFORE RUNNING IT!!!
